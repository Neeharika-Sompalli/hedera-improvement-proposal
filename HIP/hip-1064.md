## Abstract

This HIP proposes a reward mechanism that will incentivize nodes to remain active on the network. The definition of active node is described below. The minimum reward per day for nodes will be a configurable property decided by the governance of the deployed network. This minimum reward may be adjusted based on fees already paid throughout the day.

## Motivation

The goal is to give a strong incentive for node operators to keep them active and properly configured throughout every staking period.

## Rationale

Clearly defining the criteria for node activity, we can ensure that rewards are distributed fairly, incentivizing nodes to remain active and contribute to the network’s stability and growth.

### Terminology

<dl>
<dt>Judge</dt>
<dd>In the hashgraph algorithm, honest nodes that are online and contributing to consensus will regularly create unique famous witnesses, called judges, in nearly every round.</dd>
<dt>Active Node</dt>
<dd>A node is an *Active Node* if it creates a "judge" in a significant fraction of rounds during a staking period, for example 80%. Any node that is trustworthy and submits events will create judges. If the node doesn’t submit events or when other nodes don’t build on this node’s events, the node will not create judges.</dd>
</dl>

**User Stories**

The implementation will be tested under various scenarios, including:

- As a node operator, I expect to receive at least a minimum node reward when the
  node is active for at least `nodes.activeRoundsPercent` rounds
- As a node operator, I do not expect to receive any node rewards when the node
  is not active for at least `nodes.activeRoundsPercent` rounds
- As a network operator, when `nodes.adjustNodeFees` is set to true, I expect
  each node reward to be reduced by the average node fees already collected
  during that period.
- As a network operator, when `nodes.adjustNodeFees` is set to false, I do not
  expect each node reward to be reduced by the average node fees already
  collected during that period.
- As a network operator, I expect each active node to receive at least a
  minimum reward defined by `nodes.minNodeReward`

## Specification

There will be three configurable properties added, which can be changed using `FileUpdate` transaction signed by the governance of the deployed network.

- `nodes.minNodeReward` : A minimum daily node reward amount. Each node SHALL
  receive at least this many tinybar each day that the node is "Active".
- `nodes.adjustNodeFees` : A flag to adjust node fees. If this is set, the
  network SHALL reduce the rewards given for a staking period by the average
  node fees already collected during that period.
- `nodes.activeRoundsPercent` : A percentage value relating to active nodes.
  A node MUST create a judge in at least this percentage of rounds to be
  considered active. This is set to 80% by default.

Note that the reward is adjusted by same amount for all nodes when `staking.fees.adjustNodeFees` is true. I.e., Alice’s node is paid the constant reward minus the average node fees received that day, averaged across all nodes. We will NOT subtract the node fees earned by Alice in particular.

The node rewards are distributed at the end of a staking period using CryptoTransfer transactions from `ledger.fundingAccount` to each of the node accounts. Since each CryptoTransfer only allows `ledger.transfers.maxLen` number of transfers, based on the it is possible there will be multiple CryptoTransfers that will distribute rewards based on number of node accounts in the network.

This HIP modifies the following state protobufs.

- Currently PlatformState’s ConsensusSnapshot contains information about the `judge_hashes`. But, it doesn’t provide the creator ids. We will deprecate the existing `judge_hashes`  and add a list of `judges`. Each `Judge` will include the creator node id and the judge hash for that node. Any node that didn’t create a judge in a round will not be present in the list.

```
/**
 * A consensus snapshot.<br/>
 * This is a snapshot of the consensus state for a particular round.
 *
 * This message SHALL record consensus data necessary for restart
 * and reconnect.
 */
message ConsensusSnapshot {
    ....
    /**
     * A list of SHA-384 hash values.<br/>
     * The hashes of all judges for this round.
     * <p>
     * This list SHALL be ordered by creator ID.<br/>
     * This list MUST be deterministically ordered.
     */
    repeated bytes judge_hashes = 2 [deprecated=true];
    ....
    /*
     * A list of judges.
     * This list SHALL be ordered by creator ID.<br/>
     * This list MUST be deterministically ordered.
     */
    repeated Judge judges = 6;
}

/**
 * A judge information
 */
message Judge {
    /**
     * The creator node ID who created this judge.
     */
    uint64 creator_id = 1;

    /**
     * SHA-384 hash value of this judge
     */
    bytes judge_hash = 2;
}
```

- To store the number of rounds in a staking period and the number of rounds in which each node created judges, a new singleton state `NodeRewards`will be added to `TokenService` . This singleton state will be updated at the end of every round.

```
syntax = "proto3";

package com.hedera.hapi.node.state.token;

option java_package = "com.hederahashgraph.api.proto.java";
// <<<pbj.java_package = "com.hedera.hapi.node.state.token">>> This comment is special code for setting PBJ Compiler java package
option java_multiple_files = true;

/**
 * A node rewards message. This is used to find number of active nodes in a staking period based on number of judges
 * each node created in that period.
 */
message NodeRewards {
    /**
     * Number of rounds in a staking period.
     */
    uint64 num_rounds_in_staking_period = 1;
    /**
     * Number of judges created by each node in a staking period.
     */
    repeated NodeActivity node_activities = 2;
}
/**
  * A node activity containing number of judges created in a staking period.
 */
message NodeActivity {
    /**
     * Node ID of the node.
     */
    uint64 node_id = 1;
    /**
     * Number of judges created by the node.
     */
    uint64 num_judge_rounds = 2;
}
```

## Backward Compatibility

Existing nodes will not require any changes to their software or configuration to be eligible for rewards, as long as they meet the active criteria.

## Security Implications

No known security concerns.

## How to Teach This

This HIP incentivizes node operators for keeping the node active by guaranteeing a minimum reward in the periods that they accomplish this.

## Rejected Ideas

- We considered using the number of transactions submitted by a node to assess node activity.
   - This was rejected in favor of counting rounds with judges because the latter
     approach incorporates consensus network assessment of node "honesty" and
     is more "fair".
